# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis Dashboard

This project is my third data analysis project and my first using Power BI as a fresh graduate. The goal was to develop a fully interactive business intelligence dashboard that provides key insights into hotel operations, customer behavior, and booking performance for AtliQ Hospitality â€” a hotel chain operating across major cities in India.
